👋 Hi, I’m @Jakub-Gryczka

Nice to see you! My name is Jakub Gryczka, I am from Poland and I attend to the technical school with specialisation of IT 🏫. Currently I am on my third year, and I have 17 years old, but I am interested in computers since I remember. I was always that guy who was installing Windows or mods to Minecraft for my friends 😂. I have invented power of the internet when I was struggling with game issues when my dad couldn't solve that problem, I was about 7 years old then and I started solving my problems with help from Internet. Now I am interested into technology, cybersecurity, hardware and programming. My goal is to become successful React Developer, and that idea was born when my dad asked me to make a website for him, so I started researching for new web technologies, I have found couple of channels on YouTube that I am watching constantly, and now I'm really passionated about Frontend! Currently I am learning JavaScript from video courses on Udemy and JetBrains Academy, my next goal is to master my CSS skills and bring them to more advanced level and after that learn SCSS 😄.

Thanks for reading! Have a nice day!
